# GMS-Asteriods-Game
scratch the "4th-player shooter" idea 
I think my approach to the multiplayer aspect is interesting but not perfect. I know that
It just became too hard to hold up the idea of it. 
But, what I did do is just as engaging as a typical shooter. (I hope)
Ok, so I added everything besides the enemy factions in the Game Maker Tutorial in Space Rocks
And, another thing
I am going to make a boss fight. 
Yes yes. I know. It's going to take a bit more time. 
That's why, I'm going to work overtime. 
Even after the class is over, I'm still going to work on this project. 
But yeah
Thats it. See ya.
