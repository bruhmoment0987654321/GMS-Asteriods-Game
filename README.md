scratch the "4th-player shooter" idea 
I think my approach to the multiplayer aspect is interesting but not perfect. I know that
It just became too hard to hold up the idea of it. 
But, what I did do is just as engaging as a typical shooter. (I hope). 
Ok, so I added everything besides the enemy factions in the Game Maker Tutorial in Space Rocks.
Thats it. See ya.
