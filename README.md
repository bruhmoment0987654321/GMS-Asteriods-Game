scratch the "4th-player shooter" idea 
I think my approach to the multiplayer aspect is interesting but not perfect. I know that
It just became too hard to hold up the idea of it. 
But, what I did do is just as engaging as a typical shooter. (I hope)
So, my approach is to make it so you FIND the other players and they help you on the adventure.
They are controlled by you but they don't die. 
The bad part wih the ships is that they can't use power-ups
So yeah, thats all I have to say.
See ya.
